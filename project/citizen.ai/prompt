# Citizen AI Web Application Project

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive Citizen AI web application that serves as an intelligent platform for citizen engagement and community services management. This application will bridge the gap between citizens and local government through AI-powered tools and services.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for robust component development
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling and design system
- **React Router DOM** for client-side routing and navigation
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **Recharts** for data visualization and analytics dashboards

### Backend API
- **FastAPI** (Python) for high-performance REST API development
- **Pydantic** for data validation and serialization
- **SQLAlchemy** for database ORM and management
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database for data persistence
- **Redis** for caching and session management

### AI Integration
- **IBM Granite 3.3-2B Instruct Model** as the core language model for intelligent responses
- **Hugging Face Transformers** library for model integration and inference
- **Custom AI pipeline** for sentiment analysis and text classification
- **Natural Language Processing** for automated categorization of citizen concerns

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker** containerization for consistent deployment

## AI Model Integration

### IBM Granite 3.3-2B Instruct Model
- **Purpose**: Primary language model for chat assistance and text understanding
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Natural language understanding and generation
  - Context-aware responses
  - Multi-turn conversation handling
  - Domain-specific knowledge about government services

### Custom AI Pipeline
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify citizen submissions as positive, negative, or neutral
- **Text Classification**: Automatically categorize concerns into relevant departments
- **Priority Scoring**: AI-driven priority assessment based on urgency and impact
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify emerging issues and patterns in citizen feedback

## Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Citizens**: User profiles and authentication
- **Concerns**: Citizen-reported issues and problems
- **Feedback**: Positive feedback and suggestions
- **Categories**: Classification system for different types of submissions
- **Departments**: Government departments and responsible parties
- **Analytics**: Aggregated data for reporting and insights

### Key Relationships
- Citizens can submit multiple concerns and feedback
- Concerns are categorized and assigned to departments
- Analytics track trends across all submissions
- AI models process and enrich all text data

## API Architecture

### RESTful Endpoints
```
/api/v1/auth/          - Authentication and user management
/api/v1/concerns/      - Concern submission and management
/api/v1/feedback/      - Feedback collection and processing
/api/v1/chat/          - AI chat assistant endpoints
/api/v1/analytics/     - Data analytics and reporting
/api/v1/admin/         - Administrative functions
```

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket connections for live chat
- Server-sent events for real-time updates
- Push notifications for status changes

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- Secure authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### AI Ethics
- Transparent AI decision-making processes
- Bias detection and mitigation in AI responses
- Privacy-preserving AI techniques
- Audit trails for all AI-generated content

## Performance Requirements

### Scalability
